# PUBG-Game-Prediction

# Overview
This GitHub repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting the outcome of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) games. The project involves data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the implementation of a CatBoost model for prediction. The dataset used comprises 29 features, such as player statistics, equipment usage, and game-related information.

# Contents
Data Wrangling: Clean and organize the dataset, handling missing values, and converting categorical data into numerical form.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize insights about the game using various graphs and perform exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns and relationships in the data.

Feature Engineering: Improve model performance by creating new features or modifying existing ones. This involves normalizing features, dropping unnecessary columns, and creating new features based on combinations of existing ones.

CatBoost Model: Utilize CatBoost for its effectiveness with categorical data, speed, and accuracy. The model is trained to predict PUBG game outcomes, and the performance is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
